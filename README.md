This project analyzes Zomato food delivery data to uncover insights into customer behavior, operational efficiency, and ordering trends. The raw dataset was first cleaned and preprocessed using Python in Google Colab before being loaded into a SQL database for further analysis. An interactive Power BI dashboard was then built to visualize the findings.

The dashboard allows stakeholders to explore key metrics across locations, cuisines, delivery performance, and user preferences.

Key highlights:

Cleaned and standardized raw data using Python (Pandas) in Google Colab before SQL querying

Performed data extraction and transformation using SQL to prepare the dataset for visualization

Analyzed customer behavior, including top-ordering cities, peak hours, and preferred cuisines

Tracked delivery performance using KPIs like average delivery time, delays, and cancellation rates

Identified top cuisines based on order count and customer satisfaction

Explored reasons for order cancellations using categorized data fields

Built a user-friendly, filterable Power BI dashboard with dynamic visualizations

Tech stack:

Google Colab (Python, Pandas) for data cleaning and preprocessing

SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for querying and transformation

Power BI for dashboard creation and data modeling

DAX for calculated fields and KPI visualizations

Power Query for data import and shaping
